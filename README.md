# Mypaint-Styrene - a slightly extended Styrene
_(Perhaps it's wrapped in some cellophane)_

[Original Styrene repository](https://github.com/achadwick/styrene/)

Right now, the only addition is a `--build-7z` option that (unsurprisingly)
produces a 7z archive of the build output.
Refer to the [original docs](https://styrene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for more information.
